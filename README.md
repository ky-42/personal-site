# Kyle Denief Personal Site 
https://kyledenief.me

This is the repo for my personal/portfolio website. It has support for posting your blogs and projects. I made this to help me show off my projects and have a place to direct people to learn more about me. I think its also just cool to have something your proud of to show others!

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions! Also you can host the site with your own info if you want but if you do I just ask you send it to me so I can see!
