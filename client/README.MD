# Client

This is the client-side code for the website. It is written in TypeScript using Rect and styled with styled-components.

## Configuration

To configure the client, please refer to the [README in the config folder](../config/README.md). The client is configured using a JSON file, making it easy to customize with your own information.

## File Structure

The file structure of the client is based on the structure described [in this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-better-way-to-structure-react-projects/).

## Managing Content

The content management page can be found at /manage. This page lets you create, edit, and delete content and devblogs on the website. The password is set via the ADMIN_PASSWORD variable in the `.env` file in the server directory.
