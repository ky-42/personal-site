# Client

This is the client-side code for the website. It is written in TypeScript and React, and styled with styled-components.

## Configuration
To configure the client, please refer to the [README in the config folder](../config/README.md). The client is configured using a JSON file, making it easy to customize with your own information.

## File Structure
The file structure of the client is based on the [Frontend File Structure](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-better-way-to-structure-react-projects/) article. This structure is designed to help you organize your code in a logical way, making it easier to maintain and update your application.

## Managing Content
The content managment page can be found at /manage. This page lets you create, edit, and delete content and devblogs on the website. The password is set via the `.env` file in the server directory. The variable is named ADMIN_PASSWORD.
