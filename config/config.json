I've always been interested in programming and using computers to make things so it seemed like a natural next step. The first time I tried programming was in grade 6 but I really learned how it all works in grade 9. Ever since I've been learning more and making random stuff. Other than programming I got a few hobbies like hiking, reading, and a few sports. I also play a few games, usually RTS games or shooters.",
