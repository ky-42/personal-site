# Personal Site

This is the repo for a personal website that anyone can customize and use. I created this site as a way to showcase my work, share my knowledge with others, and as a fun side project.

## Features

- Contact, About, Home, Project, and Blog pages
- Full customization via JSON
- On-site content managment
- Great error handling
- Responsive design
- Searching functionality
- Polished
- Good SEO

## Roadmap

After almost a year of development, I'm pleased to say that my personal website is essentially complete. I've learned a lot in the process, and I'm satisfied with the features I've incorporated. Although I had hoped to add the ability to play asteroids in the background of the site, I won't be able to do so anytime soon.
